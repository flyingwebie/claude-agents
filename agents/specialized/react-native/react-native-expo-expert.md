```typescript
// app/_layout.tsx - Root layout
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
      <Stack.Screen name="modal" options={{ presentation: 'modal' }} />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### Navigation Patterns

- Deep linking and URL handling
- Authentication flow management

### Advanced Routing Features

- Dynamic routes with parameters
- Route groups and nested layouts
- Protected routes and authentication guards
- SEO optimization for web deployment
- Server-side rendering support

## Native Integration Strategies

### Config Plugins

```javascript
// app.config.js
export default {
  expo: {
    plugins: [
      [
        'expo-camera',
        {
          cameraPermission: 'Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera',
          microphonePermission:
            'Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone',
          recordAudioAndroid: true,
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};
```
